# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Problems

#### Issue: "Invalid API Key" Error
**Symptoms:** Receiving 401 Unauthorized responses
**Causes:**
- Expired API key
- Incorrect key format
- Missing Authorization header

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your API key in the dashboard
2. Ensure header format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
3. Regenerate API key if expired
4. Check for trailing spaces in the key

#### Issue: OAuth Token Errors
**Symptoms:** "invalid_client" or "invalid_grant" errors
**Causes:**
- Incorrect client credentials
- Mismatched redirect URI
- Expired authorization code

**Solutions:**
1. Verify client ID and secret
2. Ensure redirect URI matches exactly
3. Use authorization code within 10 minutes
4. Check OAuth endpoint URL (v1 vs v2)

### Performance Issues

#### Issue: Slow API Response Times
**Symptoms:** Requests taking >5 seconds
**Causes:**
- Large response payloads
- Database query optimization needed
- Network latency

**Solutions:**
1. Use field selection: `?fields=id,name,email`
2. Implement pagination for large datasets
3. Cache frequently accessed data
4. Use compression: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`

#### Issue: Rate Limiting
**Symptoms:** 429 Too Many Requests errors
**Causes:**
- Exceeding request limits
- Not implementing backoff

**Solutions:**
1. Check rate limit headers in responses
2. Implement exponential backoff
3. Upgrade to higher tier if needed
4. Distribute requests over time

### Integration Issues

#### Issue: Webhook Delivery Failures
**Symptoms:** Missing webhook notifications
**Causes:**
- Endpoint not responding
- Invalid response codes
- Network timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure endpoint returns 200 status
2. Respond within 10 seconds
3. Implement retry mechanism
4. Check webhook logs in dashboard

#### Issue: Data Sync Problems
**Symptoms:** Inconsistent data between systems
**Causes:**
- Race conditions
- Failed webhook deliveries
- Clock synchronization

**Solutions:**
1. Use idempotency keys for critical operations
2. Implement data reconciliation jobs
3. Use timestamps for ordering events
4. Handle duplicate events gracefully

### Database Connection Issues

#### Issue: Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Symptoms:** "Connection timeout" errors
**Causes:**
- Too many concurrent connections
- Long-running queries
- Connection leaks

**Solutions:**
1. Set appropriate pool size (100-200 for high traffic)
2. Implement connection timeouts (30 seconds)
3. Use connection retry logic
4. Monitor for connection leaks

#### Issue: Slow Query Performance
**Symptoms:** Database timeouts, slow responses
**Causes:**
- Missing indexes
- Inefficient queries
- Large table scans

**Solutions:**
1. Add indexes on frequently queried fields
2. Use query explain plans
3. Implement query caching
4. Paginate large result sets

### Mobile App Issues

#### Issue: App Crashes on iOS
**Symptoms:** App closes unexpectedly
**Causes:**
- Memory issues
- iOS version compatibility
- Third-party library conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Update to latest app version
2. Restart device
3. Clear app cache/data
4. Check iOS compatibility matrix

#### Issue: Network Connectivity Problems
**Symptoms:** "No internet connection" errors
**Causes:**
- Poor network signal
- Firewall restrictions
- DNS issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check network connection
2. Try different network (WiFi/cellular)
3. Verify firewall settings
4. Clear DNS cache

### Payment Processing Issues

#### Issue: Payment Failures
**Symptoms:** Transactions not completing
**Causes:**
- Invalid card details
- Insufficient funds
- Bank restrictions

**Solutions:**
1. Verify card information
2. Check available balance
3. Contact bank for restrictions
4. Try alternative payment method

#### Issue: Processing Delays
**Symptoms:** Payments taking hours to process
**Causes:**
- Bank processing times
- Fraud detection holds
- System maintenance

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for standard processing time (24-48 hours)
2. Contact support for urgent transactions
3. Check for fraud alerts
4. Monitor system status page

## Debugging Tools

### API Testing
- Use Postman or curl for API testing
- Check request/response headers
- Validate JSON payload format
- Test with minimal request first

### Logging
- Enable debug logging in your application
- Monitor API response codes and times
- Log request IDs for tracing
- Set up alerts for error patterns

### Monitoring
- Set up health checks for critical endpoints
- Monitor response times and error rates
- Track API usage against rate limits
- Use APM tools for performance monitoring
